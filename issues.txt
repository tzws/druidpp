1. it does not differentiate long and int type. the differentiate is made in SQLExprParser.cpp.
2. change std::list to std::vector
3. add a char* based identifierEquals("SAVEPOINT"
4. In SQLExprParser, the std::list returned, is newed. Should use auto_ptr, or
make it memeber of class.
5. anything newed, Should be removed;
6. the list/vector/set of pointers, should be released.

7. change list to vector

8. how about the delete in SQLExprParser?? what's the effect?
